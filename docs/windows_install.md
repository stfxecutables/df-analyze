# Windows Installation

For those who can't use the [shell
script](https://github.com/stfxecutables/df-analyze?tab=readme-ov-file#local-install-by-shell-script)
to install the necessary `df-analyze` dependencies for a local install, this
should be the attempted installation procedure.

**You must use PowerShell for all commands** (not cmd.exe). For Windows 10 or
11, it is recommended users install the new [Windows
Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n0dx20hk701), and to use this
instead. Once installed, it will appear in the start menu as "Windows
Powershell", and this will be what you want to use with df-analyze and for
all command-line installation instructions below.

## \*\***NEW**\*\* Installation via `uv`

1. If you haven't already, install [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n0dx20hk701)
2. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/install/windows)
   - For those new to the command line, I recommend the following settings during the various dialogues during installation:
      - Make sure "Associate .sh files to be run with Bash" is checked
      - Choose "Visual Studio Code" or "Notepad++" as the default Git editor, NOT Vim
      - In "Adjusting your PATH environment", choose the second or third option
      - Use bundled OpenSSH
      - Use native Windows Secure Channel library
      - In "Configuring line ending conversions" dialogue, choose first or second option ("Checkout Windows, commit Unix" or "Checkout as-is, commit Unix", respectively), NOT the third option ("Checkout as-is, commit as-is")
      - Use MinTTY as the terminal emulator
      - Choose "Only ever fast-forward" for the default behaviour of `git pull`
      - Use Git Credential Manager
      - Leave "Configuring extra options" at defaults (just "Enable file system caching" checked)
2. Install `uv` (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#__tabbed_1_2)
   - i.e. run `powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"`, and then restart your Windows Terminal
   - be sure to read and understand the notes on execution policies in the link above
3. Make sure `uv` is up-to-date and you have a Python version installed compatible with df-analyze:
   ```shell
   uv self update
   uv python install 3.13.11
   ```
4. Choose a location where you want to install df-analyze, and navigate there in the terminal:

   ```shell
   cd ~\Documents
   git clone https://github.com/stfxecutables/df-analyze.git
   cd df-analyze
   uv sync
   uv pip install pytorch_tabular
   ```
5. Test the install is working by viewing the CLI help for df-analyze by running:

   ```shell
   uv run df-analyze.py --help
   ```

If you get an error at this point involving lines like:

```
 × Failed to build `numpy==1.26.4`
```

or
```
The Meson build system

[...]

Project name: NumPy
Project version: 1.2X.X

[...]

hint: This usually indicates a problem with the package or the build environment.
```

just after running the `uv sync` or `uv pip install pytorch_tabular` commands, you'll need
to use the [Legacy install procedure below](#legacy--fallback-installation-via-pyenv-win).


# Legacy / Fallback Installation via `pyenv-win`

## `pyenv-win` Setup

1. Install [`pyenv-win`](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win?tab=readme-ov-file#quick-start)
   by doing the following steps, in order:
   1. In PowerShell, run: `Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win/master/pyenv-win/install-pyenv-win.ps1" -OutFile "./install-pyenv-win.ps1"; &"./install-pyenv-win.ps1"`
   2. Reopen PowerShell
   3. Run `pyenv --version` to check if the installation was successful.
   4. Run `pyenv install 3.12.5`
   5. `cd` to the directory where you cloned `df-analyze`
   6. Run `pyenv local 3.12.5`
      - this creates a permanent file `.python-version` in the `df-analyze`
        directory, and whenever you subseqeuntly open a new PowerShell and `cd`
        to this location, ensures that the correct python version is automatically
        used
   7. Restart PowerShell
   8. `cd` to the directory where you cloned `df-analyze`
   9. Run `python --version` and confirm that the output is `Python 3.12.5`

For all future uses of PowerShell, it should now be that case that if you are in the
`df-analyze` directory, then the correct python version is used. You should always
check this before doing anything else by running:

```powershell
python --version
```

first before doing anything. If for some reason the above does not return `Python 3.12.5`,
you can manually activate the correct python version at any location by running

```powershell
pyenv shell 3.12.5
```

## Virtual Environment Creation

Make sure to `cd` to the `df-analye` directory, and that `python --version` returns `Python 3.12.5`.
Then, run the following command:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
```

This creates a virtual environment directory `.venv` in the `df-analyze`
directory. Now, we need to activate this virtual environment (i.e. tell
PowerShell to use the Python binary and libraries contained in the local
`.venv` folder rather than the global python 3.12.5 installation files).
In order to this, it is best to first set some permissions by running:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

It might be a good idea to restart PowerShell after running this command.

### Activating the Virtual Environment

The environment can then be activated by running one of:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate
```

or

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\activate.ps1
```

or

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

To confirm this worked, you should be able to run one of:

```powershell
where python
```

or

```powershell
(get-command python).Path
```

You should see something like `df-analyze/.venv/bin/python.exe` somewhere in the output.
If you do, virtual environment creation was a success.

### Installing Libraries to the Virtual Environment

After you have confirmed that you have installed and activated the virtual
environment, first run the following command to update `pip`:

```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel --no-cache-dir
```

Then run the following command:

```powershell
python -m pip install cli-test-helpers joblib jsonpickle lightgbm llvmlite matplotlib numba numpy openpyxl optuna pandas pyarrow pytest "pytest-xdist[psutil]" python-dateutil scikit-image scikit-learn scipy seaborn statsmodels tabulate torch torchaudio torchvision tqdm typing_extensions skorch "transformers[torch]" accelerate "datasets[vision]" protobuf sentencepiece "pytorch_tabular"
```

All necessary dependencies should now be installed. You can verify that the installation
was a success by running:

```
python df-analyze.py --help
```

This should produce the documentation for the `df-analyze` tabular prediction interface.

## After Installation

Anytime you open PowerShell and navigate to the `df-analyze` directory, you will have
to [activate the virtual environment](#activating-the-virtual-environment) prior to
running `df-analyze`. But you won't have to do any of the other install procedures again.
